This article has been accepted and will soon be published, the early doi of our papaer will be 10.1038/s41592-025-02667-6.

Dark sectioning aims at remove the scattering background in fluorescence images based on dark channel priority and dual frequency seperation.
This code is finished by Ruijie Cao and Prof. Peng Xi in Peking University. We claim an Apache liscence for Dark sectioning.
