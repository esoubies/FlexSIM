# SLM-SIM Reticulum (ML-SIM)

This dataset was presented first  in the ML-SIM original publication [1].
It corresponds to a standard 9-image SIM acquisition of endoplasmic structures imaged with SLM illumination. 
The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/charlesnchr/ML-SIM/raw/master/Test_data/SLM-SIM%20syrlyso640-5.tif)
