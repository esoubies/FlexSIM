# SLM-SIM Tetraspeck (FairSIM)

Presented in the fairSIM original publication, this dataset shows tetraspeck structures imaged with SLM-SIM. 
For a more homogeneus resolution improvement, 12 images (4 orientations with 3 phases each) were acquired. 
The dataset can be dowloaded from [here](https://github.com/fairSIM/test-datasets/releases/download/SLM-SIM-Bielefeld/SLM-SIM_Tetraspeck200_680nm.tif).
